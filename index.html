                    <b>The "leaky pipeline" is a now common metaphor used to describe how women and
                        other historically marginalized groups frequently exit STEM studies and careers.
                        The metaphor is also used to explain why there are so few women occupying highly credentialed
                        STEM occupations such as professorships or research positions.
                    </b>
                </h4>
                    <br>
                <h5>
                    The metaphor is as follows: if water (women) flows through a pipeline with cracks,
                    much of the water will leak out (women exiting STEM) and a significantly smaller amount of
                    water will remain at the end of the pipeline. In this metaphor, the starting and ending
                    points of the pipeline vary, but what remains the same is that the pipeline itself marks the
                    process of attaining higher and higher levels of STEM involvement – for example, the path from
                    graduating with a bachelor's degree, to a master's degree, to a doctorate.
                    <br><br>
                    The leaky pipeline metaphor often serves as a teaching tool. It is a clear way to visualize women's

                    The metaphor invites inquiry into who it is that "leaks" from the pipeline, where the pipeline leaks,
                    and how to prevent leakage. These types of questions have caused many policy solutions regarding
                    increasing women's involvement in STEM to focus on educational benchmarks, such as early math
                    and science education.<sup>1</sup>

                The tepid success<sup>2</sup> of interventions like these

                critiques: placing too much focus on benchmarks, placing
                the entirety of the "blame" on the women themselves, and assuming a universal experience in STEM,
                to name a few.

                While the pipeline metaphor illustrates when women "leak" out of CS, it does little to explain the
                reasons for the cracks in the pipeline.
                <br><br>
                When looking at the data for female graduates of CS degree programs over time,
                <span style="background-color: yellow;"> an interesting story is told.</span>
                Below is a dashboard tracking the retention rates of men versus women of varying
                races and ethnicities as they obtain higher CS degrees.

                The graphs show that the CS degree pipeline is leaky overall.
                Uniformly across all races and ethnicities reported, <span style="background-color: yellow">
                the retention rates of women and men as graduates of higher CS degrees are similar,</span> even though
                there are significantly more men than women in the field. The largest
                gender disparity is a 16% difference in "leakage" favoring women.

                there are significantly less women in the field to begin with.
                <br><br>
                To explore this new framing, let's take a deeper look into the

                Here we see that at the Bachelor level the amount of women are increasing;
                    women are entering the field, and graduating, at a faster rate than men.
                    However, the ratio of men to women in CS Bachelor's programs
                    in the U.S. has remained fairly consistent since 2008, at around 18%.

                    Interestingly, as the level of the degree rises the
                    proportion of women graduates does as well.</span>

                When viewed in tandem with the prior dashboard, we can see two things:
                <br><br>
                1) The biggest "leaks" must happen prior to graduating with a bachelor's degree, given how the
                proportion of women only increases as they learn more about the field.
                <br><br>
                2) There needs to be more significant effort to increase the gender diversity of the field, given
                its stagnantion since 2008.

                – spoiler – is influenced by the above diversity disparities in CS.

                <b>One thing the leaky pipeline metaphor is exceptionally poor at is taking into account the reasons
                    of why women leave CS. It assumes CS is a desirable field for everyone, failing to consider
                    factors like academic interests changing over time, or the unfortunate fact that the culture
                    of CS drives many women and people of color away from the field.
                </b>
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h5>
                What is it about the culture? CS culture largely focuses on working long hours – even at the expensive
                of one’s quality of life; it is unrelenting for those who want to break into the field and begin to
                learn CS, often excluding all but the best right from the start; and it is historically hyper-masculine
                which has engrained in the field implicitly sexist attitudes towards women.
                <br><br>
                As reported by Stanford University, women in CS are forced into one of two groups.<sup>1</sup> In the first group
                women mold themselves to fit within the male model of computing, meaning becoming “one of the guys”,
                working obsessive hours programming, losing their femininity, avoiding traditionally female discussion
                topics and styles, and suppressing negative reactions to sexist jokes and comments. These changes take
                a toll on many women, forcing them to chose between CS and their non-CS friends, social life, and way
                of life.
                <br><br>
                <span class="h1">

                    <b>"Perhaps men and women alike would be better off if [CS] culture did not
                        require giving up the rest of their lives."
                        <sup>2</sup></b>

                </span>
                <br><br>
                The second group women take their own path and attempt a more balanced approach at computing, however
                they risk – and often receive – immense criticism. These women are also often taken less seriously than
                their conforming peers and risk losing opportunities for it.<sup>3</sup>
                <br><br>
                The lack of women in the field creates a feedback loop, isolating those who choose to stay. This has
                also lessened the amount of female role-models and mentors for women emerging in the field.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately this culture does not leave upon graduation. For women that enter the CS occupations in
                academia and industry they face a similar uphill battle.
            </h5>

                Entire books<sup>4</sup> have been written about the
                historically racist and sexist “geek and bro culture” of Silicon Valley, which encourages unhealthy
                work hours, a hyper-masculine and hyper-competitive work environment, and more-often-than-not both
                implicit and outward hostility towards women and people of color.
                <br><br>
                <span class="h1">

                    <b>28.10% of surveyed women report leaving their CS job because of lack of career growth.<sup>5</sup></b>

                </span>
                <br><br>
                Studies have shown the three biggest challenge women in CS report they face are: lack of wage growth
                (45%), discrimination (23%) and an inability to break into leadership roles (20%).<sup>6</sup> Nearly
                12% of women report sexual harassment during their time in a CS occupation. Women only hold a quarter
                of CS jobs,<sup>7</sup> yet, nearly 56% of women quit these positions compared to their male
                counterparts with similar credentials and ages.<sup>8</sup>
                <br><br>
                A failure to acknowledge how the culture of CS in academia and beyond can be hostile to women frames the
                leaky pipeline as a reflection of women’s character, assuming women that leave the field lack the
                “confidence” or the “competence” to engage with CS. Let’s return the narrative make to these women.
                Below are a series of first-hand accounts from women who had chosen to – or were forced to – leave CS.
                The hope is that the veracity of the women can illuminate that it is the culture of CS that needs to be
                changed rather than just the amount of women leaving the field.

                My experience working in a male dominated field has been mostly fine, but the problem for me is that I
                don’t feel like tech work is really doing all that much to solve the very real social problems rampant
                in the world.

                Below are two exploratory dashboards that quantify the claims from above and
                    reveal the reality of a women working in a CS occupation.
                    <br><br>
                The first series demonstrates the salary disparities along gender, racial, and ethnic lines.
                    <br><br>
                The second series tracks women’s involvement in CS occupations over time and their satisfactions
                    levels compared to men in those occupations.

                    It is important to note is that both<span style="background-color: yellow;"> men and women
                    are often less likely to report feeling “Very Dissatisfied” with their work due to fear of
                    retaliation. </span> Therefore, the below results are likely skewed in favor of presenting a more
                    satisfied picture than reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Another note is that within the second series, women are most satisfied in the sub-field of
                    teaching, likely due to it being the field with the largest proportion of women in it.

                <b> The above data story revealed three things about the leaky pipeline metaphor and the field of CS
                    itself:

            </h4>
            <br>
            <h5 style="color: white; font-weight: 400;">
                1) Women “leak out” between graduating with CS degrees at similar rates to men – meaning most leaks
                occur either before ever graduating with a degree or once one is in the workforce.
                <br><br>
                2) To avoid the pitfalls of the current leaky pipeline metaphor, scholars must focus on the reasons why
                women leave CS, rather than just the number of women leaving.
                <br><br>
                3) In order to create lasting change in the retention of women in CS, focus should be placed on
                addressing the culture of the field.

                <b> Now, where do we go from here? </b>
            </h4>
            <br>
            <h5 style="color: white; font-weight: 400;">
                Culture changes could include work towards more collaborative
                classroom models, having zero-tolerance harassment policies, name-blind application processes, and
                ensuring better mentorship for women in CS. It could look like what Harvey Mudd did, and create CS
                classes that are open to beginners and not assume prior knowledge.
                <br><br>
                While this data story does not contain all the answers, hopefully it can serve as a starting point
                for asking tough questions about what kind of people CS culture is currently designed for. Only
                through recognizing these inequities and the reasons for them can progress be made towards creating
                a field that is inclusive to all genders, races, and ethnicities.
